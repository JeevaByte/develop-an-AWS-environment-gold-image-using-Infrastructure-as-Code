# AWS Environment Gold Image - Infrastructure as Code

This repository contains Terraform code to create and manage AWS environment gold images. These gold images serve as standardized templates that can be quickly deployed for development, testing, and production environments.

## Project Overview

This solution enables clients to:

1. Define their AWS environment once as Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
2. Create standardized, repeatable deployments
3. Rapidly provision new environments for development and testing
4. Ensure consistency across all environments
5. Track changes and maintain version control

## Architecture

The architecture implements a modular approach with the following components:

- **Core Infrastructure**: VPC, subnets, security groups, and network configuration
- **Compute Layer**: EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, and AMI management
- **Data Layer**: RDS databases, S3 buckets, and other storage services
- **Security Components**: IAM roles, policies, and security configurations
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
